This program's goal is to retrieve the data of various cyrptocurrencies and store it in a database.
It should be made to run at set intervals through windows task scheduler or linux cron jobs.
It requires nuget package found here - https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data/
And to restore the MySQL backup provided in this folder.

A data analysis project is underway. I'm currently collecting more data before I can begin.
